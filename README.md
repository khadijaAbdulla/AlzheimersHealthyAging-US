# Alzheimers Disease & Healthy Aging Analysis, (US, 2015-2022)
A regional analysis about Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging of Older Adults in the United States.

### Overview
An analysis on **Alzheimer's** Disease and Healthy Aging of **Older Adults** (50+ years Old) in the **United States**, for the period of **2015-2022**. The analysis focuses on identifying the **demographics** and the **US region** with the  **highest risk** of having more Alzheimer's patients in the future. Also, highlighting some of the the **Alzheimer's indicators** in that specific region.

#### Introduction
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that is the most common cause of Dementia. The cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s Dementia results from damage to the nerves, and its progression leads to a gradual decline in the quality of life of its patients; as it affects functions such as Memory, Comprehension, Language, Attention, Reasoning, and Judgment. Although it is incurable, early detection and treatment could manage its symptoms, which delays its progression. 

#### Problem Statement
Between **2015** and **2022**, the number of Alzheimer’s patients in the **United States** have been increasing and reached around **6.07M Patients**. Other than aging, multiple factors could contribute to this increase; such as **Mental Health**, **Cognitive Decline**, Obesity, etc. This has resulted in a growing **shortage of care workers**, and incurring **high economic costs**.

### Dataset Information
Rows: 284K,  Columns: 31
Source: Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daniilkrasnoproshin/alzheimers-disease-and-healthy-aging-data](url)
Original Source: BRFSS, CDC [https://data.cdc.gov/Healthy-Aging/Alzheimer-s-Disease-and-Healthy-Aging-Data/hfr9-rurv/about_data](url)

The dataset originates from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) BRFSS system, which stands for the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The purpose of the data is to explore the Alzheimer’s Disease and Healthy Aging Data to gain access to state and national level data on a number of indicators regarding health and well-being for older U.S. adults. Furthermore, the data covers the United States, specifically the 50 US States, Washington D.C. (a.k.a District of Columbia), and 3 US Territories.

### Analysis

### Key Findings
1. Steady **decrease** in the overall Health of older adults in the US.
2. The **South** Region has the **highest** Alzheimer's risk.
3. In the South, **65+ year olds**, **Females**, and **Native Americans/Alaskans** are more likely to develop Alzheimer's.
4. In the South, in 2022, **48%** of Older adults have reported having **Sbjective Cognitive Decline**.
5. In the South, by 2022, **12.3%** of Older adults have been experiencing **Frequent Mental Distress**.

### Recommendations

### Tools & Libraries
* Programming language: Python
* Library: Pandas
* Environment: Jupyter Notebook
* Visualization Tool: Power BI
* Other Tools: Microsoft Excel 

### Future Improvements
1. To do a State Level Analysis instead of a Regional Level Analysis to get deeper insights into the risk of Alzheimer's Disease on different US states.
2. To look into the risk of different indicators based on Age Group, Gender, and Race/Ethnicity.
3. To use Machine Learning to interpolate missing data values aiming for a more accurate interpolation.
